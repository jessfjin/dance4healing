            <p class="text-muted">Studies show numerous health benefits resulting from dance. Did you know? Dancing reduces the risk of dementia by 76%, cardiovascular death by 46%, improves balance by 50%, prevents falling, improves muscle strength, lowers stress, and reduces pain. Research also shows that hand/finger exercises increase motor skills, brain communication efficiency, coordination, and timing. The benefits of dance are continuously being researched and proven to be an effective therapy that cultivates wellness and meaningful social bonds. <!--   Data collected from surveys is used to match users with buddies based on personality traits and music and dance preferences.

            <p class="text-muted"> Our product is designed to change behaviors in positive ways. We practice empathy-driven behavior design, and are mentored by David Kelley, Dennis Boyle, and BJ Fogg. Based on Fogg’s Behavior Model, we increase ability by offering dance videos recorded from our in person classes, and enable 24/7 access. We create effective behavior triggers, and put hot triggers in front of motivated people through AI informed buddy matching. Research shows people perform better in a group, but really excel with a buddy.

No matter how miserable I felt or how much my joints would hurt I know everything would disappear while I was dancing in such a supportive environment. Dance4Healing has had such a big impact in my life that I have continued dancing after the program finished. I have enrolled to ballroom dance, zumba, and bollywood dancing.

              <p>"Dance4Healing came into my life when I was afraid because of pending cancer diagnosis. I participated in Dance4Healing and that ‘old happy feeling’
                  started to come back. The dancing raised the endorphins and gave me a ‘happy boost.’ Being with others who had experienced similar medical challenges
                  was a support system in the making. Also the art and sharing we did at the end of each session made me feel accepted. I could go on! Looking forward
                  each week to my next Dance4Healing get-together, was what kept me going. A regular dance class would not have had the same effect. I needed to
                  be with those going through the same thing. Also my finances were limited and the class was offered at ‘no cost’ Thank you Amy and Stanford for what
                  you did and do for us. I couldn’t have faced the medical challenge and kept my spirits up without you."  <br><br>- Joan L Cornbleet</p>

                <p>"Last year January I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, the lump was found by my OB and I had a lumpectomy in March of last year, went through
                    chemo and radiation, and finished my radiation last year September and I am now a cancer survivor, trying to learn a little bit about myself, and keep some
                    stress away from my life, do some dancing, and some support with the community. Joining Dance4Healing program has been amazing. I love my time
                    with amazing and loving people, and It’s been a great healing journey. The bond we have made with each other, and the bond through dance has been
                    amazing."  <br><br>- Fiona Dunphy</p>

                  <p>"Before dance, I spent a lot of time outside my body, disassociate from the body that betrayed me. But I miss her, my body, I miss feeling
                      powerful, confident, beautiful and healthy. I came to the dance as a way to reconnect with her. Everyday she and I can become one, and I can trust her once
                      again. Accept the things she can do, and forgive the things she couldn’t. And we can fall in love with each other again."  <br><br>- Deann Acton</p>

                    <p>"In 2014, I was under chemo treatment for my breast cancer. It was from a fellow patient that I learned of Dance4Healing. After reading the flyer, I signed
                        up right away though it took a couple of months for it to start. The program was very unique. We learned to dance from very caring and compassionate
                        dance professional and with people who were going through similar ordeals. We danced, laughed and shared our treatment experiences. At the meantime
                        we were getting the physical exercise we need to get stronger and healthier. This program nutures our body and mind at the time when we feel most
                        vulnerable and isolated. I would strongly recommend this program to people who are going through health challenges. I would sincerely hope that the
                        medical professionals realize the value of this program that brings to their patients."  <br><br>- Grace Leung</p>
